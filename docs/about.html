    <p>This website was created as a personal project during the summer of 2025, but has been repurposed for the DSC 180B capstone project "Title pending" by "Team members pending"</p>
    
    <p>This website template is very roughly and heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Jekyll minima theme.</a></p>
    <p>Other website inspirations like <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">the best motherfucking website</a> were used for colors and theming.</p>
    <p>The rest of the website was made to try to be as 'minimal' and 'modern' as possible. Though I am not a huge fan of modern designs like this, with so much padding. I also tested javascript here, so there might be artifacting idk</p>
